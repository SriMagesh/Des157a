                <p>This particular image is interesting, because this photo is actually a screenshot from a video of my brother and I biking along our local elementary school attempting to catch frisbees with one hand. This video was taken by my Dad as I throw frisbees to my brother, Adi, and he is biking quickly to catch the incoming frisbee with one hand. At this moment, Adi and I were learning how to bike with one hand, so this could almost be a test of our skills with one - handed biking. This image relates to my topic, because it was one of the hotspots that my brother and I would go to during quarantine to practice our biking skills.

                <p>This image is a younger Kestrel holding some sort of jelly on top of a pier?? I honestly do not know, and I’m curious to inquire more about that. It looks as if it might be a series of memories, and she is going through specific moments in her life. The mysterious aspect of this image is definitely the item that she is holding in her hand. The image does a good job using the ⅓ rd rule, and I want to know more about the specific location of where she is, and what she might be doing at the moment.

                <p>When I was browsing through the awwwards site, one site which truly grabbed my attention was this portfolio by KATSUAKI
                    UTSUNOMIYA. The design of his portfolio is so elegant and extensive with different manners to view his personal projects. His use of scrolling to display images was unlike anything I've seen before. Though a minor animation, changing the z perspective on the images as a the user hovers through a project's image added a greater depth to his work. In additon, utilizing an image cursor as a person hovers over project titles is an aspect I seek to employ on my own work.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals</h2>

                <p>I never really considered modals ever in my life. I never even knew what modals were until I read the article. What stood out to me was how much thought and effort goes into designing such a minimal aspect of ui ux design. I have always come across modals, but I never really paid much attention to it. Learning that they are used to grab the user’s attention. There are many UI tricks to make the modal stand out, and grab the user's attention. One effect which stood out to me was the lightbox effect in which the rest of the page is darker, while the modal shines through. It’s one aspect I seek to use in my own design.</p>
