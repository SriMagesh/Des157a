                <p>I never really considered modals ever in my life. I never even knew what modals were until I read the article. What stood out to me was how much thought and effort goes into designing such a minimal aspect of ui ux design. I have always come across modals, but I never really paid much attention to it. Learning that they are used to grab the user’s attention. There are many UI tricks to make the modal stand out, and grab the user's attention. One effect which stood out to me was the lightbox effect in which the rest of the page is darker, while the modal shines through. It’s one aspect I seek to use in my own design.</p>
