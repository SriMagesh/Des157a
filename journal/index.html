                <p>When I was browsing through the awwwards site, one site which truly grabbed my attention was this portfolio by KATSUAKI
                    UTSUNOMIYA. The design of his portfolio is so elegant and extensive with different manners to view his personal projects. His use of scrolling to display images was unlike anything I've seen before. Though a minor animation, changing the z perspective on the images as a the user hovers through a project's image added a greater depth to his work. In additon, utilizing an image cursor as a person hovers over project titles is an aspect I seek to employ on my own work.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals</h2>

                <p>I never really considered modals ever in my life. I never even knew what modals were until I read the article. What stood out to me was how much thought and effort goes into designing such a minimal aspect of ui ux design. I have always come across modals, but I never really paid much attention to it. Learning that they are used to grab the user’s attention. There are many UI tricks to make the modal stand out, and grab the user's attention. One effect which stood out to me was the lightbox effect in which the rest of the page is darker, while the modal shines through. It’s one aspect I seek to use in my own design.</p>
