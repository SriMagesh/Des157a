        <h2>Project Summary </h2>
        <div>
            <p> The project which I seek to update is the every picture project
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <div>
            <p> With this project, I seek to truly convey my experience during quarantine that I spent with my brother. I hope that I can add on more scroll features, so that I can better convey the idea of moving along my memories. With that in mind, I seek to change the idea so its as if a person is moving along a window pane. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <div>
                <p> I plan to make this seem like a person is moving through a window pane. The overall look and feel should be warm and inviting. I want the user to feel welcomed, and style should be similar to "Where's Waldo". The colors I plan to use are red, blue, white, and black. These are very patriotic colors, and that was unintentional :) 
                </p>
            </div>
        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <div>
            <p> For my interactions, I want to utlize scroll positions to initiate the movement of the biker, as he travels from pane to pane. In addition, I seek to add hexagonal shapes on the side of each pane for the user to click on, and be able to view images and even zoom in on. Finally, all of this is done through horizontal scroll.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <div>
            <p> My experience goal is to make it seem as if the person is biking through my memories, and viewing snapshots of my mind. I hope that they are able to take a sneak peek into my mind, and the precious moments that I was able to spend with my brother.
